## Mission

The mission of the OpenCHAMI consortium is to steward the collaborative development and continuous evolution of cloud-like software to manage High Performance Computing capacity regardless of the size or deployment platform.  We are guided by the operators and practitioners who use modern tooling and concepts to address the needs of classical HPC applications and the growing AI/ML and Data Science community that wish to leverage HPC capacity within their own workflows, to meet their needs with their own tools.

## Contributions

All repositories in the OpenCHAMI github organization share the same [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [code of conduct](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which can both be found in the organization's [.github](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/.github) repository.

General Development Ideas are tracked in our [roadmap](https://github.com/OpenCHAMI/roadmap) repository.  To get a common view of active development across all repositories, review the main [Roadmap Project](https://github.com/orgs/OpenCHAMI/projects/1).  Development issues from all repositories should be linked there for easy collaboration.

We welcome feedback and PRs from the community!
